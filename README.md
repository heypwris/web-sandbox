# web-sandbox

this project really isn't too much !! the focus behind it is learning web development and GitHub at the same time, not an actual project to post out the world !! i donkt expect it to go too far, and i might just forget it in a year or so, but at least it's here !!

i'm focusing on html, css, and javascript directly in the browser for now, though it might expand into java/even javascript again for the back-end side of things !!

the project is attempting to be an about me type thing, like an introduction but more for the sake of practicing, and not truly providing links to the world to reach out !!

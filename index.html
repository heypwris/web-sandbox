            <h2>my interests !!</h2>

            <!-- intro/programming -->
            <article>
                <p>much of my interests surround programming, though i also love cooking, reading, and - while not really an interest - chatting !! i'm focusing much of my programming time into web development like html, css, and js, though i'm really not good at any of it !! that's why i'm making this, at least, to maybe practice what i'm learning ?? i feel like i have a good understanding of html, which isn't even really a programming language..</p>
            </article>

            <!-- cooking/eating -->
            <article>
                <p>but as for my other interests, cooking is really fun !! though i could probably never cook the foods i'm intrested in, i always love the process of cooking and the end result, even if it isn't good. much of what i do in cooking is usually breakfast-style, like diced potatoes, toast, tomatoes, eggs, etc !! it's all rlly fun, and i want to expand into like,, meat and fish but i'm worried i would give myself salmonella or smth like that !! oh, i'm also good at baking too !!</p>
            </article>
            
            <!-- chatting -->
            <article>
                <p>lastly, chatting !! while i don't rlly talk to too many people except close friends, i still love talking with them !! i think i'm also closed off,, like i seem to only be friends with people who are trans/lgbtq, almost out of safety ?? like the middle school boys at my school,, i can't,, knowing they're still gna be there in high school is even worse, but it should be fine !! most of the time, though, i'm talking about games like genshin impact/minecraft or anime, even though i barely watch anime !! like it's just stuff that really makes me and my friends happy, and all stuff that we really appreciate !!</p>
